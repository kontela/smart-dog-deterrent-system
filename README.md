# smart-dog-deterrent-system
 Smart dog deterrence system that uses sound to keep dogs out of restricted areas like food canteens and libraries, applying the Jetson Nano's object detection capabilities with camera streams.


This project uses YOLOv5 for object detection to dog with custom database. It's built using the YOLOv5 model, which is a state-of-the-art object detection system from Ultralytics.
